This is an open source, UI rich, note taking application built natively in Java. The App provides elegant UI with Secure PIN functionalities and is built using the latest Android Jetpack components such as Navigation, Live Data, Room database and Jetpack Fragments. The application is build following a MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) design pattern. Feel free to contribute and add other functionalities with pull requests :)
